In this experiment, the vanilla bot played against the modified bot.

The tree sizes were as followed:
test 1: 400
test 2: 800
test 3: 1000
test 4: 1500
test 5: 2000

In test 1, the modified bot won over the vanilla bot with it having 42 wins versus 39 wins and had draws of 19 times.
In test 2, the modified bot barely won over the vanilla bot with it having 40 wins versus 39 wins and had draws of 20 times.
In test 3, the vanilla bot won over with it having 42 wins over the 33 wins and 25 draws.
In test 4, the vanilla bot won over with it having 60 wins over the 30 wins and 10 draws.

The modified version only wins more games if the tree size is small. I suspect this is because of the exploration factor being high for the modified bot.
This high exploration factor enables it to search more nodes quickly to find better moves than the vanilla bot, so that's why it won in test 1 and 2.

However, this leads to it falling behind in test 3, 4, and 5 because it keeps trying to explore rather than win games. By doing so, the vanilla bot catches
up and is able to use the fact that it has higher exploitation to beat the modified bot.
